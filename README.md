# â˜• Variables

A variable is a container (storage area) used to hold data.  
Each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).


public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Variables
       String name = "Aman";
       int age = 30;
       String neighbour = "Akku";
       String friend = neighbour;
   }
}

# ðŸ“‹ Data Types

Data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of  data associated with variables which is essential to know since different data  types occupy different sizes of memory.

There are 2 types of Data Types :
Primitive Data types : to store simple values
Non-Primitive Data types : to store complex values



 - Primitive Data Types :- 
These are the data types of fixed size.

 - Non-Primitive Data Types :- 
These are of variable size & are usually declared with a â€˜newâ€™ keyword.
	Eg : String, Arrays
  
- Non-Primitive Data Types :- 
These are of variable size & are usually declared with a â€˜newâ€™ keyword.
	Eg : String, Arrays

# Homework Problems
- Try to declare meaningful variables of each type. Eg - a variable named age should be a numeric type (int or float) not byte.
- Make a program that takes the radius of a circle as input, calculates its radius and area and prints it as output to the user.
- Make a program that prints the table of a number that is input by the user. 
(HINT - You will have to write 10 lines for this but as we proceed in the course you will be studying about â€˜LOOPSâ€™ that will simplify your work A LOT!)
